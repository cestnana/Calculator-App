# TODO-1: 4 functions - add, subtract, multiply and divide.
# TODO-2: Add these 4 functions into a dictionary as the values. Keys = "+", "-", "*", "/"
# TODO-3: Use the dictionary operations to perform the calculations. Multiply 4 * 8 using the dictionary.

# Idea-1: Write out a flowchart to plan your program.
# Idea-2: To call multiplication from the operations dictionary, try code like this:
# result = operations["*"](n1= 5, n2= 3)
# result would then be equal to 15.
# Idea-3: modify the start logo.

# Extra TODO:
# 1. display whole calculation
# 2. print available operators in more clever way
# 3. User Input Validation
# 4. Clear the screen at the beginning?

Functionality
Program asks the user to type the first number.
Program asks the user to type a mathematical operator (a choice of "+", "-", "*" or "/")
Program asks the user to type the second number.
Program works out the result based on the chosen mathematical operator.
Program asks if the user wants to continue working with the previous result.
If yes, program loops to use the previous result as the first number and then repeats the calculation process.
If no, program asks the user for the fist number again and wipes all memory of previous calculations.
